value of i :14
value of i :15
value of i :16
value of i :17
value of i :18
value of i :19

Example 2

% for {set a 10} {$a >= 0} {incr a -1} {puts "value of a is decremented: $a"};
value of a is decremented: 10
value of a is decremented: 9
value of a is decremented: 8

value of a is decremented: 6
value of a is decremented: 5
